He also said a special panel of experts and local leaders will be set up by April 11 to "draft a blueprint" for rebuilding damaged areas.

As for Fukushima No. 1, Kan said that once the situation is stabilized, he intends to look at various aspects of the crisis, including how to balance national electricity supplies in the future. Kan did not, however, clarify his position on whether Japan should reduce its heavy reliance on nuclear power.

"Of course solar, wind and biomass energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide are very important," Kan said. "But in a sense, I think that nuclear power should also get credit from the viewpoint of not emitting carbon dioxide and that naturally, we need to continue thinking about how to balance supply."
