Kan names quake at pep talk



Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Friday that preparations for restoration and reconstruction work have begun in disaster-hit areas and Japan will prevail over the hardships caused by the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.

He did not, however, offer an outlook on when the damaged Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant will be stabilized.

Kan Friday night marked three weeks since the deadly tsunami ripped up the northeast coast by naming the temblor that spawned it the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (Higashi Nihon Dai-Shinsai).

"I am confident that we will overcome the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake . . . and re-create a wonderful Japan," he said.

"And I promise that I myself and my Cabinet will stand at the forefront and devote all of our energy" to rebuilding it.

To prepare for the restoration, Kan said he will freeze part of the fiscal 2011 budget, which cleared the Diet Tuesday, and transfer the money to a supplementary budget.

"I want to prepare the first extra budget and use it to get rid of debris, build temporary housing, secure jobs and restore industry," Kan said, adding the government will submit the first legislation for the plan this month.
