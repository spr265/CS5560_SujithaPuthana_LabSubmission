The researchers will focus on computational phenotyping and will produce disease prediction models from machine learning and statistical tools.
The researchers will develop tools that use Bayesian statistical information to generate causal models from large and complex phenotyping datasets.
The researchers will build a computational information engine that uses machine learning to combine gene function and gene interaction information from disparate genomic data sources.
